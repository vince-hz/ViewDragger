Setup forwards superView and backwards superView. Then you can drag view backwards and forwards. This is an alternative to modal viewController with transition animation.
When user drag the animation view, the dragger lift the view to the window level. And when the drag ended, the dragger will place the animation view to the right place.
All you have to care is the backwards view and forwards view. Also backwards frame and forwards frame needs to be set.
